Ludo Snap
=========

Ludo is a work in progress libretro frontend.

Ludo's user interface is distraction free and configuration is always optional.

Scan your games and browse your collection categorized by system with playlists showing in-game screenshots.

A contextual menu gives you access to actions and quick save / quick load anytime.

We chose the best emulators for the job, configured with sane defaults guaranteeing a balance of speed and accuracy.
