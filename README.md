### A minimalist front-end for Libretro emulators

**Focus on playing**

Ludo's user interface is distraction free and configuration is always
optional.

Scan your games and browse your collection categorized by system with
playlists showing in-game screenshots.

A contextual menu gives you access to actions and quick save / quick load
anytime.

We chose the best emulators for the job, configured with sane defaults
guaranteeing a balance of speed and accuracy.
