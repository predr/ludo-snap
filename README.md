Snap package for Ludo, a work in progress libretro frontend written in Go.

Ludo's user interface is distraction free and configuration is always optional.

Scan your games and browse your collection categorized by system with playlists showing in-game screenshots.

A contextual menu gives you access to actions and quick save / quick load anytime.

We chose the best emulators for the job, configured with sane defaults guaranteeing a balance of speed and accuracy.
